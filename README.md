# Growth - Personal Planer

----------------------Overview----------------------------
A desktop app which I'm building with SQLight, C# and WPF. 
The idea is to help keep track of tasks, meetings, budget, diet, etc. 
I am aiming to make it modular, i.e. giving the user the building blocks,
and allowing them to customise it in their own way. 

Currently in early developmnet!
